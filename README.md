# Land-Rental-System
Utilizing the Python programming language, I was able to develop a Land Rental System, which is user-friendly and process works of the renting and returning lands to the user as per their choice. This system is designed and developed to fulfil the requirement of the land renting system. Additionally, using python tools like dictionary, file read and write operations, loops and other necessary tools, we were able to develop a functional system. Overall, this Land Renting System project was done for better UI so that the user can do activities of the Land rent and buying process.
